#Primary Key

'''
When creating a table, you should also create a column with a unique key for each record.

This can be done by defining a PRIMARY KEY.

We use the statement "INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY" which will insert a unique number for each record. Starting at 1, and increased by one for each record.
'''

#Create primary key when creating the table:

import mysql.connector

mydb = mysql.connector.connect(
  host="localhost",
  user="root",
  password="PassSQL@123",
  database="studentform"
 
)
mycursor = mydb.cursor()

mycursor.execute("CREATE TABLE customer1 (id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY, name VARCHAR(255), address VARCHAR(255))")
